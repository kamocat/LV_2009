That means the offensive (benefit) is how many points that team tends to score, and the defensive (detriment) is how many points tend to be scored on that team.</p> 		<p>From there, it's an iterative process.  For each match, the team's valubilities is recalculated by the proportion of its previous valubilities to the valubilities of the two other teams on the alliance.  The offensive valubility is multiplied by the alliance's score, and the defensive valubility is multiplied by the opposing alliance's score.  The drift of valubilities seems to slow down to less than 0.01 per iteration by the 150th iteration.  (While the valubilites are calculated in floating point, they are saved as integers, because it's decreases complexity to save all data as one datatype, and it's misleading to post the team numbers as floating point).  All posted results have been calculated to the 150th iteration or greater.</p> 	</div> </body> </html>
